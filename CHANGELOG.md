# 📑 NEURAL MEMORY LOGS: [DUNGEON-ADVENTURES]

## 🟢 [v1.0.0] - PATIENT ZERO (THE GENESIS UPLINK)
**Status:** `ACTIVE_MALIGNANCY` | **Date:** 2026-01-09

This is the definitive stabilization of the Dungeon-Adventures entity. The engine has been purged of development artifacts and is ready for initial infection of the global network.

### 💉 INFECTED LOGIC (Added)
- **Neural Core Initialization:** Compiled the .NET 8.0 Engine with `Spectre.Console` and `Pastel` integration.
- **84x24 Reality Anchor:** Established the fixed-coordinate grid to prevent terminal buffer overflows.
- **SpookyCleanup Integration:** Injected the cross-platform force-purge logic to ensure clean compilation cycles.
- **Asset Forge:** Established the `Assets/` directory structure for world maps and visual artifacts.
- **Archive Manager:** Initialized the linking logic between the core simulation and the forge.

### ☣️ CORRUPTIONS (Suppressed)
- **Namespace Alignment:** Synced `BluePrints` casing to resolve build-time reality tearing.
- **Recursion Suppression:** Patched the `ArchiveManager` loop that led to fatal system collapse.
- **Rendering Fix:** Corrected the "Dungeon Void" bug to ensure high-speed visual stability.

## 🛠️ LOGGING PROTOCOL
1. **Incremental Growth:** Use `da-bump` to trigger a new log entry.
2. **Zero-Deletion:** Do not remove old logs. History must remain as a testament to the machine's decay.
3. **Categorization:**
    - `INFECTED LOGIC`: New systems added to the stack.
    - `CORRUPTIONS`: Suppressed errors or stability patches.
