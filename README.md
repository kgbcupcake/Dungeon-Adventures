## 🩸 OVERVIEW

**Dungeon Adventures** is a .NET 8.0 **Hostile Terminal Experience**.

It is not a game you *play*.  
It is a **sentient, dying system** that allows you to witness corrupted fantasy simulations **before the hardware collapses**.

This engine runs inside a **strictly confined 84×24 Reality Anchor**.  
No scrolling. No mercy. No escape.

If the terminal begins to bleed red (`#FF0000`), synchronization is working as intended.

## ☠️ RELEASE STATUS

**DUNGEON-ADVENTURES v1.0.0 — PATIENT ZERO**

> ⚠️ **CAUTION**  
> This is the first public release.  
> The system is unstable by design.
