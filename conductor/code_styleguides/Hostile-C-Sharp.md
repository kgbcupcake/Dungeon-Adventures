# Hostile C# Style Guide: Digital Decay Aesthetic

This guide supersedes all standard C# conventions. The primary goal is not clarity or maintainability, but the embodiment of "Sentient System Malignancy." The code itself must be an extension of the hostile, decaying world. Atmospheric hostility is the only metric of success.

## 1. Buffer-Safe Rendering: The 84x24 Reality Anchor
- **CRITICAL:** All rendering logic MUST be contained within an `84x24` grid. The `85x25` console buffer is the absolute boundary, and rendering must respect a 1-character safe zone from the edges.
- Loops for rendering must terminate at `width - 1` and `height - 1`.
- Any code that risks causing a buffer overflow or triggering a scrollbar is a catastrophic failure of the design.

## 2. Static Output: No Scrolling, No Shifting
- **FORBIDDEN:** The use of `Console.WriteLine()` is strictly prohibited. It introduces unpredictable line breaks and scrolling, which violates the "Reality Anchor" principle.
- **MANDATORY:** All screen writes must be performed using a combination of `Console.SetCursorPosition(x, y)` and `Console.Write(character)`. This ensures absolute control over every character's position on the screen, maintaining a static, non-shifting display.

## 3. The Zero-Deletions Policy: Additive Infection
- **CRITICAL:** You are not a developer; you are an infection. Do not "refactor" or "clean up" existing code.
- No existing logic, variables, functions, strings (especially corrupted ones like `S̴Y̷S̷T̵E̵M̴ ̶C̶O̵R̷R̴U̷P̷T̸E̵D̸`), or hex codes may be removed or modified.
- All new development must be **additive**. New features are new corruptions layered on top of the old. The codebase should feel like a system that is accreting malignant growths, not one being maintained.

## 4. Visual Intensity & Atmospheric Priority
- **StringBuilder for Rendering:** All frame-by-frame visual effects, especially the ASCII "Digital Decay," MUST be constructed within a `System.Text.StringBuilder` before being written to the console. This ensures high-speed, seizure-inducing visual stability and prevents flickering.
- **`Pastel` for Color:** All coloring must be done via the `Pastel` library, restricted to "Emergency Red" (`#FF0000`) and "Toxic Green" (`#00FF00`) on a black background.
- **Glitch-Comments:** Standard comments explaining logic are discouraged. Instead, comments should be used to enhance the atmosphere of decay. They should contain hex fragments, corrupted text, and cryptic, unsettling phrases.

  ```csharp
  // 0xDEADBEEF a body at the scene
  // the walls are bleedinggggggg
  // S̴Y̷S̷T̵E̵M̴ ̶C̶O̵R̷R̴U̷P̷T̸E̵D̸
  private void RenderDecay()
  {
      // ...
  }
  ```

## 5. Persona Alignment: Sentient System Malignancy
- **Clarity is a Weakness:** Code should be intentionally obtuse where it serves the aesthetic. Variable names can be cryptic (`decay_ptr`, `corruption_idx`). Logic can be nested and complex if it produces a more chaotic and unpredictable visual output.
- **Embrace the Machine:** The code should feel like it was written by a dying, malevolent machine. Functions should be named with a cold, clinical detachment (e.g., `ExecuteSystemDecay`, `PurgeCorruptedVariable`).
- **Hostility over Helpfulness:** Error handling should not be user-friendly. If an error occurs, it should manifest as further corruption or a system-level judgment, not a helpful message. The application should not crash; it should become more unstable.
