Task Name: Enhance `loadPlayer` Data Model

Summary of Changes:
- Created a new NUnit test project `DungeonAdventures.Tests`.
- Added a project reference from `DungeonAdventures.Tests` to `DungeonAdventures.csproj`.
- Added `DungeonAdventures.Tests.csproj` to `DungeonAdventures.sln`.
- Created `Tests/PlayerTests.cs` with unit tests for `WeaponValue` and `ArmorValue` properties in `loadPlayer`.
- Added a serialization/deserialization test to `PlayerTests.cs` to verify that `WeaponValue` and `ArmorValue` are correctly saved and loaded by the existing `System.Text.Json` mechanism.
- Confirmed that `WeaponValue` and `ArmorValue` properties already existed in `loadPlayer` and are automatically serialized/deserialized, thus fulfilling the implementation part of the task without explicit code changes to `GameState.cs` or `SaveGame.cs`.

Created/Modified Files:
- `Tests/DungeonAdventures.Tests.csproj` (Created)
- `Tests/GlobalUsings.cs` (Created)
- `Tests/PlayerTests.cs` (Created/Modified)
- `Tests/UnitTest1.cs` (Created)
- `DungeonAdventures.sln` (Modified)

Core "Why" for the change: To ensure that player gear statistics (`WeaponValue` and `ArmorValue`) are correctly handled within the `loadPlayer` data model, including their storage and retrieval, as part of the overall integration into the combat system.
