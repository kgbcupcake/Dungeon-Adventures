I have completed the following tasks:

1.  **Refactored the Devlog to a Dedicated Tab:**
    *   Moved `RenderWorldForgePanel()`, `RenderDevLog()`, `RenderArchiveBrowser_Flat()`, and the "INJECT_SYSTEM" button functionality into separate tabs within the main `ControlHubs` tab bar in `Src/Gui/DevGui.cs`. This organizes the developer GUI into a single-column layout with distinct tabs for "BIO-ENGINEERING", "INDUSTRIAL FORGE", "WORLD FABRICATOR", "SYSTEM LOG", "SYSTEM", and "NEURAL ARCHIVE".

2.  **Integrated ImGui Controls with Conductor Class:**
    *   **`Src/Gui/DevGui_Adventures.cs`**:
        *   Modified `ExecuteAdventureFabrication()` to use `_conductor.ExportData()` for saving adventure data.
        *   Modified the "Inject Adventure into Master" button's logic within `RenderAdventureCreator()` to use `_conductor.ExportData()` for injecting adventure data.
    *   **`Src/Gui/DevGui_Forge.cs`**:
        *   Modified `RenderAdvancedWeaponLab()` to use `_conductor.ExportData()` for fabricating weapons.
        *   Modified `RenderItemCreator()` to use `_conductor.ExportData()` for fabricating items (both "FABRICATE TO DISK" and "FABRICATE & INJECT INTO SHOP" buttons).
        *   Modified `RenderAttachmentCreator()` to use `_conductor.ExportData()` for exporting attachments.
    *   **`Src/Gui/DevGui_Specialization.cs`**:
        *   Modified `RenderDungeonBuilder()` to use `_conductor.ExportData()` for injecting dungeon data, and added a `try-catch` block for error handling.
        *   Modified `RenderQuestDesigner()` to use `_conductor.ExportData()` for publishing quest data.
        *   Modified `PerformGemInjection()` to use `_conductor.ExportData()` for fabricating and exporting gems.
    *   **`Src/Gui/DevGui_System.cs`**:
        *   Modified `RenderFullStatEditor()` (for player creation) to use `_conductor.ExportData()` for creating new player profiles.
        *   Modified `LoadPlayerFromFile()` to use the new `_conductor.LoadPlayerProfile()` method.
        *   Modified `RenderArchiveBrowser()` to use the new `_conductor.DeletePlayerProfile()` method for purging player profiles.
    *   **`Src/GameEngine/Conductor.cs`**:
        *   Added a new public method `LoadPlayerProfile(string filePath)` that wraps `LoadGame.LoadProfile()`.
        *   Added a new public method `DeletePlayerProfile(string filePath)` that wraps `File.Delete()`.
        *   Added `using DungeonAdventures.Src.GameData.Entities;` to resolve a `PlayerData` type not found error.

3.  **Ensured ImGui Implementation is Free of Common Errors:**
    *   Reviewed all `DevGui` files and confirmed that `ImGui.Begin()` and `ImGui.End()` calls are correctly paired within `if` blocks, and `PushID`/`PopID` pairs are handled appropriately, mitigating common ImGui errors like missing `ImGui.End()`.

4.  **Addressed Inconsistency in `RenderDungeonBuilder()`**:
    *   Changed the direct `File.WriteAllText` call to use `_conductor.ExportData()` for consistency with other save operations.

The project builds successfully with no errors after these changes.
